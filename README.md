# ctl-control
Simple script to use all your "${insert_name}ctl" stuff

## NOT for shell scripts

Only for command line (cli, terminal, console) usage. Not intended for scripts.

## Concepts

Basically, this can be just a bunch of aliases for common \*ctl commands.

alias ctl-system='systemctl status'

**or**

$> ctl -s apache2 status **---** equals to 'systemctl status apache2'

Yeah, that's more like it.

## So...

Is it needed? Is it meaningful? No. Lmao.
