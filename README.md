# ctl-control
Simple script to use all your "${insert_name}ctl" stuff

## NOT for shell scripts

Only for command line (cli, terminal, console) usage. Not intended for scripts.

## Main Idea

Basically, this is just a bunch of aliases for common \*ctl commands.

alias ctl-system='systemctl status'

## So...

Is it needed? Is it meaningful? No. Lmao.
